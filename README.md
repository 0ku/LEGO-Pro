# LEGO-Pro
This was a project created over the summer of 2021 to experiment and identify pricing differences on various marketing sites. In the case of this project, I used Python in order to webscrape brand new and unopened LEGO sets from Kijiji and compared them to their retail prices on Amazon.

The LEGO set # associated to each set is used in order to more accurately identify the correct sets. In cases where a set cannot be found on Amazon, the respective information slot is filled instead with 'N/A'.  

Unfortunetly the program currently no longer works due to webpage changes on Amazon which caused certain HTML elements to become unavailable for searching purposes. In any case, included in the main folder is a .csv file that contains the most recent webscrape conducted by the program which contains a good majority of price comparisons - a sort of proof of concept.
