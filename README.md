# LEGO-Pro
This was a project created over the summer of 2021 to experiment and identify pricing differences on various marketing sites.  
In the case of this project, I used Python in order to webscrape brand new and unopened LEGO sets from Kijiji and compared them to their retail prices on Amazon.  
The LEGO set # associated to each set is used in order to more accurately identify the correct sets. In cases where a set cannot be found on Amazon, the respective information  
slot is filled instead with 'N/A'.
